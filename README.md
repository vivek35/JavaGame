### Problem Statement: 

Build a game, where two players with different strategies are playing against each other.  

* Scissor beats paper.  

* Rock beats scissors.  

* Paper beats rock.  

* if both players choose the same, itâ€™s a tie.  

Implement two players:  

-Player A: chooses paper every time  

-Player B: makes a random choice every time.  

The players will compete 100 times against each other.  

As result we would like to know, who wins more often?  

An example result would look like this:  

"Player A wins 31 of 100 games"  

"Player B wins 37 of 100 games"  

"Tie: 32 of 100 games"  

"Winner is: Player B (37 to 31 wins)"  

Description:  

The game is buit using core Java.  

Used JUNIT for unit testing method and tried to cover every scenario possible.

Used mockito for method verification and parameters.
